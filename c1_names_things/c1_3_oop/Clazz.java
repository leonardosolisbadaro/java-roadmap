/**
 * -> Java instance
 * 
 * Java instances are objects that are based on classes. For example, Bob may be
 * an instance of the class Person.
 * 
 * Every instance has access to its own set of variables which are known as
 * instance fields, which are variables declared within the scope of the
 * instance. Values for instance fields are assigned within the constructor
 * method.
 * 
 * -> Creating a new Class instance in Java
 * 
 * In Java, we use the new keyword followed by a call to the class constructor
 * in order to create a new instance of a class.
 * 
 * The constructor can be used to provide initial values to instance fields.
 * 
 * -> Java dot notation
 * 
 * In Java programming language, we use . to access the variables and methods of
 * an object or a Class.
 * 
 * This is known as dot notation and the structure looks like this:
 * 
 * instanceOrClassName.fieldOrMethodName
