/**
 * A class represents a single concept.

 * A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program

 * 
 * In Java, when we compile a program, each individual class is converted into a
 * .class file, which is known as byte code.
 * 
 * The JVM (Java virtual machine) is used to run the byte code.
